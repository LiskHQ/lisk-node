Lisk provides a cost-efficient, fast, and scalable Layer 2 (L2) network based on [Optimism (OP)](https://stack.optimism.io/). that is secured by Ethereum.

This repository contains information on how to run your own L2 node on the Lisk network.

## System requirements

The following system requirements are recommended to run Lisk l2 node.

### Memory

- Modern multi-core CPU with good single-core performance
- Machines with a minimum of 16 GB RAM (32 GB recommended).

### Storage

- Machines with a high performance SSD drive with at least 4 TB free

## Supported networks

| Ethereum Network | Status |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Lisk             | âœ…     |
| Lisk Sepolia     | âœ…     |

## Usage

> **Note**:
> <br>It is currently not possible to run the node until the configs for Lisk have been merged to the [superchain-registry](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry).
> <br>We currently have an [open PR](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/superchain-registry/pull/234) to add Lisk Mainnet config. We will soon create a PR to add the config for Lisk Sepolia Testnet as well.

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LiskHQ/lisk-node.git
cd lisk-node
```

### Docker

- Ensure you have an Ethereum L1 full node RPC available (not Lisk), and copy `.env.*` (based on the network) to `.env` setting `OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC`. If running your own L1 node, it needs to be synced before the specific Lisk network will be able to fully sync. You also need a Beacon API RPC which can be set in `OP_NODE_L1_BEACON`. Example:

  ```
  # .env file
  # [recommended] replace with your preferred L1 (Ethereum, not Lisk) node RPC URL:
  OP_NODE_L1_ETH_RPC=<L1 api rpc>
  OP_NODE_L1_BEACON=<beacon api rpc>
  ```

- Start the node:

  ```
  docker compose up --build
  ```

- You should now be able to `curl` your Lisk node:

  ```
  curl -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBlockByNumber","params":["latest",false]}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8545
  ```

### Source

#### Build

To build `op-node` and `op-geth` from source, follow this optimism document [documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/tutorials/node-from-source)

#### Run

Navigate to your `op-geth` directory and start service by running the command:

For Lisk Sepolia Testnet:

```sh
./build/bin/geth \
  --http \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --http.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --verbosity=3 \
  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://rpc.sepolia-api.lisk.com/ \
  --op-network=lisk-sepolia \
  --datadir=$DATADIR_PATH \
  --override.canyon=0
```

For Lisk Mainnet:

```sh
./build/bin/geth \
  --http \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --http.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.addr=localhost \
  --authrpc.jwtsecret=./jwt.txt \
  --verbosity=3 \
  --rollup.sequencerhttp=https://rpc.api.lisk.com/ \
  --op-network=lisk \
  --datadir=$DATADIR_PATH
```

Refer to the `op-geth` configuration [documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#op-geth) for detailed information about available options.

Navigate to your `op-node` directory and start service by running the command:

For Lisk Sepolia Testnet:

```sh
./bin/op-node \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND \
  --l1.beacon=$L1_BEACON_URL \
  --l2=ws://localhost:8551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
  --network=lisk-sepolia \
  --syncmode=execution-layer
```

For Lisk Mainnet:

```sh
./bin/op-node \
  --l1=$L1_RPC_URL \
  --l1.rpckind=$L1_RPC_KIND \
  --l1.beacon=$L1_BEACON_URL \
  --l2=ws://localhost:8551 \
  --l2.jwt-secret=./jwt.txt \
  --network=lisk \
  --syncmode=execution-layer
```

Refer to the `op-node` configuration [documentation](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/management/configuration#op-node) for detailed information about available options.

Note: Some L1 nodes (e.g. Erigon) do not support fetching storage proofs. You can work around this by specifying `--l1.trustrpc` when starting op-node (add it in `op-node-entrypoint` and rebuild the docker image with `docker compose build`.) Do not do this unless you fully trust the L1 node provider.

## Snapshots

Not yet available.

### Syncing

Sync speed depends on your L1 node, as the majority of the chain is derived from data submitted to the L1. You can check your syncing status using the `optimism_syncStatus` RPC on the `op-node` container. Example:

```
command -v jq  &> /dev/null || { echo "jq is not installed" 1>&2 ; }
echo Latest synced block behind by: \
$((($( date +%s )-\
$( curl -s -d '{"id":0,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"optimism_syncStatus"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:7545 |
   jq -r .result.unsafe_l2.timestamp))/60)) minutes
```
